#Collapse all comments inside the project by default.

= Introduction =

Some people feel very annoyed from long comments taking most of the space on their screens in projects. Thus, they prefer that they are collapsed and can be expanded only when needed. 

However, the disadvantage is on copying and pasting the first /** is missed and you have to add them manually.

If you still would like to have such feature, follow the steps in eclipse IDE.
